My name is Kailee Zingler.

I'm currently an undergraduate at the [New Mexico Institute of Mining and
Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico_Institute_of_Mining_and_Technology).
I will receive my BS in Biology in May of 2016.

I'm currently involved in three separate undergraduate research ventures.  Since
January of 2013, I have been working at the [Center for Leadership in Technology
Commercialization (CLTC)](http://management.nmt.edu/cltc/) under Dr. Peter
Anselmo on market research, patent law and language, business plans,
commercialization of medical technology, and intellectual property law.
Starting in February of 2014 I began research with the [Chemistry
Department](http://infohost.nmt.edu/~chem/) under Dr. Liliya Frolova in
Synthetic Organic and Metalorganic Medicinal Chemistry and Drug Discovery. I've
recently begun conducting research on what I believe to be my strongest passion;
since January of 2015 I've worked with the [Biology
Department](http://infohost.nmt.edu/~biology/) under Dr. Snezna Rogelj
conducting Antibacterial Drug Discovery using a broad range of microbial
techniques testing on various bacterial cell lines.

My professional aspiration is to attend graduate school in Medicinal
Microbiology in the hopes of using my broad background of knowledge to help the
world deal with the largest threat to health in the modern world, superbugs.
