My name is Kailee Zingler.

I am a recent graduate from New Mexico Tech [New Mexico Institute of Mining and
Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico_Institute_of_Mining_and_Technology), 
magnan cum laude, with my Bachelors of Science
in Biology. I moved to Chicago, Il, from Socorro, NM in July of 2016.

During my undergraduate years I was involved in three separate undergraduate research ventures.  Since
January of 2014, I have been working at the [Center for Leadership in Technology
Commercialization (CLTC)](http://management.nmt.edu/cltc/) under Dr. Peter
Anselmo on market research, patent law and language, business plans,
commercialization of medical technology, and intellectual property law.
Starting in February of 2014 I began research with the [Chemistry
Department](http://infohost.nmt.edu/~chem/) under Dr. Liliya Frolova in
synthetic organic and metalorganic medicinal chemistry and drug discovery. I've
recently begun conducting research on what I believe to be my strongest passion;
since January of 2015 I've worked with the [Biology
Department](http://infohost.nmt.edu/~biology/) under Dr. Snezna Rogelj
conducting antibacterial drug discovery using a broad range of microbial
techniques testing on various bacterial cell lines.

My professional aspiration is to become a manager for an industry lab. 
I hope to someday play an important role in fostering teamwork and organization practices to better medicinal and healthcare related research.
