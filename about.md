My name is Kailee Zingler.  

As of February 2020, I am now the Senior Compliance Administrator for the University of Chicago's [University Research Administration](https://ura.uchicago.edu) conflict of interest team.
Here, I manage a variety of compliance tasks relating to financial conflicts of interest, conflicts of commitment, and foreign influence on university research.

From January 2019 through April 2020, I worked as the Research Program Manager for the [Digestive Diseases Research Core Center](http://www.uchicagoddrcc.org/research-cores) as well as for [Dr. Eugene Chang's Lab](https://changlab.uchicago.edu) in the Gastroenterology Department of the [University of Chicago Medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago_Medical_Center).
While there, I worked on two important NIH grant resubmissions. The first was the resubmission for the NIH NIDDK T32 program at UChicago for over 30 years, we achieved a score of 17 and were renewed. The second was for the NIH NIDDK Digestive Diseases Research Core Center program, we achieved a score of 18 and were renewed.
Also during this time I maintained the DDRCC and Chang lab websites, as well as for the new UChicago Pouchitis RC2 Research Program, and for the UChicago Microbiome Medicine Program.

I am a December 2018 graduate of the [MSc. in Biomedical Informatics](https://grahamschool.uchicago.edu/academic-programs/masters-degrees/biomedical-informatics) program at the University of Chicago. Here I received all A's in my courses and focused my attention on Population Health Informatics. My Thesis was titled, The Feasibility of Utilizing EHR Data to Supplant Survey Data Collection: A Case Study. 

From August 2016 through January 2019, I worked for the [University of Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago) Biological Sciences Division as a Financial Analyst in the
[Office of Clinical Research](http://bsdocr.bsd.uchicago.edu). Here, I helped own Epic Research Functionality daily operations of clinical research billing as well as training of research staff.

In May 2016 I graduated from New Mexico Tech [New Mexico Institute of Mining and
Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico_Institute_of_Mining_and_Technology), 
magna cum laude, with my Bachelors of Science
in Biology.

During my undergraduate years I was involved in three separate research ventures.  From
January of 2014, I worked in initial stages of the [Center for Leadership in Technology
Commercialization (CLTC)](http://management.nmt.edu/cltc/) under Dr. Peter
Anselmo doing market research, researching patent law and FDA regulations, helping to draft business plans,
working towards commercialization of medical technology and intellectual property created at New Mexico Tech.
I began research with the [Chemistry
Department](http://infohost.nmt.edu/~chem/) in February of 2014 under Dr. Liliya Frolova in
synthetic organic and metalorganic medicinal chemistry and drug discovery. Starting in January of 2015, I conducted 
microbiological testing of our drug candidates on various bacterial cell lines with the [Biology
Department](http://infohost.nmt.edu/~biology/) under Dr. Snezna Rogelj.     

In May of 2012 I graduated Salutatorian from the [Albuquerque Institute for Mathematics and Science (AIMS@UNM)](http://www.aims-unm.org).
