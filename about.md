My name is Kailee Zingler.

I am an undergraduate at the [New Mexico Institute of Mining and
Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico_Institute_of_Mining_and_Technology).
I will receive my BS in Biology in May of 2016.

I'm currently involved in three separate undergraduate research ventures.  Since
January of 2013, I have been working at the [Center for Leadership in Technology
Commercialization (CLTC)](http://management.nmt.edu/cltc/) under Dr. Peter
Anselmo on market research, patent law and language, business plans,
commercialization of medical technology, and intellectual property law.
Starting in February of 2014 I began research with the [Chemistry
Department](http://infohost.nmt.edu/~chem/) under Dr. Liliya Frolova in
synthetic organic and metalorganic medicinal chemistry and drug discovery. I've
recently begun conducting research on what I believe to be my strongest passion;
since January of 2015 I've worked with the [Biology
Department](http://infohost.nmt.edu/~biology/) under Dr. Snezna Rogelj
conducting antibacterial drug discovery using a broad range of microbial
techniques testing on various bacterial cell lines.

My professional aspiration is to attend graduate school in bacteriology. 
I hope to to play a role in dealing with the largest 
threat to health in the modern world, superbugs.
