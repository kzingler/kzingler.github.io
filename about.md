My name is Kailee Zingler.

I am currently a graduate student in the [MSc. in Biomedical Informatics](https://grahamschool.uchicago.edu/academic-programs/masters-degrees/biomedical-informatics) program at the University of Chicago.
I also work for the [University of Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago) Biological Sciences Division as a Financial Analyst in the
[Office of Clinical Research](http://bsdocr.bsd.uchicago.edu). 

In May 2016 I graduated from New Mexico Tech [New Mexico Institute of Mining and
Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico_Institute_of_Mining_and_Technology), 
magna cum laude, with my Bachelors of Science
in Biology.

During my undergraduate years I was involved in three separate undergraduate research ventures.  From
January of 2014, I had been working at the [Center for Leadership in Technology
Commercialization (CLTC)](http://management.nmt.edu/cltc/) under Dr. Peter
Anselmo doing market research, researching patent law and FDA regulations, helping to draft business plans,
working towards commercialization of medical technology and intellectual property created at New Mexico Tech.
I began research with the [Chemistry
Department](http://infohost.nmt.edu/~chem/) in February of 2014 under Dr. Liliya Frolova in
synthetic organic and metalorganic medicinal chemistry and drug discovery. I started
working in January of 2015 with the [Biology
Department](http://infohost.nmt.edu/~biology/) under Dr. Snezna Rogelj. There
I conducted antibacterial drug discovery utilizing a broad range of microbial
techniques to test our drugs on various bacterial cell lines.
