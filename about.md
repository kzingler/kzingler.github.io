My name is Kailee Zingler.  

During my first summer in Law School I will act as the Teaching Assistant for Ethics and Policy Questions: Genomics, Healthcare, and Big Data. This course is a core requirement for the Master's in Biomedical Informatics program I completed in 2018. 

In fall 2021, I became a part-time Law Student at [DePaul University College of Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DePaul_University_College_of_Law). My expected graduation date is June 2025.

As of February 2020, I am now the Senior Compliance Administrator for the University of Chicago's [University Research Administration](https://ura.uchicago.edu) conflict of interest team.
Here, I manage a variety of compliance tasks relating to financial conflicts of interest, conflicts of commitment, and foreign influence on university research. I create and maintain professional relationships with diverse group of 3.000+ investigators across UChicago. I am responsible for keeping up with foreign influence federal rules and regulations.

From January 2019 through April 2020, I worked as the Research Program Manager for the [Digestive Diseases Research Core Center](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/research-funding/research-programs/digestive-disease-centers) as well as for [Dr. Eugene Chang's Lab](https://metabolism.uchicago.edu/program/faculty/eugene-b-chang) in the Gastroenterology Department of the [University of Chicago Medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago_Medical_Center).
While there, I worked on two important NIH grant resubmissions. The first was the resubmission for the longstanding NIH NIDDK T32 program at UChicago, we achieved renewal. The second was for the 30 year old NIH NIDDK Digestive Diseases Research Core Center program, we were renewed.
Also during this time, I maintained the DDRCC and Chang lab websites, as well as for the new UChicago Pouchitis RC2 Research Program and the UChicago Microbiome Medicine Program.

I am a December 2018 graduate of the [MSc. in Biomedical Informatics](https://grahamschool.uchicago.edu/academic-programs/masters-degrees/biomedical-informatics) program at the University of Chicago. 
Here I excelled in my courses and focused my attention on Population Health Informatics. My Thesis was titled, The Feasibility of Utilizing EHR Data to Supplant Survey Data Collection: A Case Study.
